# LLM MCTS Inference

This is an experimental project that integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with large language models (LLMs) to optimize test-time inference and enhance reasoning capabilities. By leveraging MCTS to systematically explore and refine possible reasoning paths, this approach improves decision-making, output quality, and test-time compute efficiency.
